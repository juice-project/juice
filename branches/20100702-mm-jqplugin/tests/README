This directory contains regression tests based on QUnit, Rhino and Env.js.
The tests are grouped in units in the test/unit/ directory.

You can run tests either in any web browser just by opening index.html
or run tests automatically from command line by calling 'ant test'.

More sophisticated testing tools like JSCoverage to measure code coverage
and Selenium for full web-application testing could be added later.
