=== Data requirements ===
none.

== Constructor arguments ==

  * ju - instance of juice
  * code - Google Analytics code

=== Source ===
http://code.google.com/p/juice-project/source/browse/trunk/extensions/GoogleAnalytics.js

The code used needs to be a valid one for the site in which the extension is inserted.  Google only updates its statistics once a day, so results will not appear for up to 24 hours after extension is applied.
