== Operation ==

Upon construction this extension performs a search via the Google Book Search API. If a full or partial preview is available for any of the passed ISBNs, the css classes for the extension logo and text are changed to 'juiceXActiveIcon' and 'juiceXActiveText', and they become clickable.  If no previews are available the css classes remain as 'juiceXInactiveIcon' and 'juiceXInactiveText' with no click function enabled.
