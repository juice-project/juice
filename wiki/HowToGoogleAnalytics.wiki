= Juice How-to - "Google Analytics" =

== Introduction ==

[http://www.google.com/analytics/ Google Analytics] is a free web-site usage tracking and analysis service that can provide lots of wonderful statistics about how people are using your site.

This How-to shows you how to use the Juice [ExtensionGas Google Analytics extension] to insert the Google specific code you need to enable it for your site.

 
== Prerequisites ==

You need to register with the [http://www.google.com/analytics/ Google Analytics] service. You can then set-up a profile, and obtain a Google Analytics web property ID for your site.  These IDs are of the format
`UA-123456-1`.

== Step One - load the extension file ==

Following the pattern described in the [HowToSimplestExtension "The simplest extension"] How-to, you need to upload The !GoogleAnalytics extension stored in a file named `GoogleAnalytics.js`, and then add a call, in your `juice-myinterface.js` file, to `juice.loadJs()` to load it.

== Step Two - using the extension ==

We are now ready to call the !GoogleAnalytics extension by creating an instance of `gasJuice`.  This takes two arguments:
 * juice - a reference to juice itself
 * code - your Google Analytics web property ID

Putting it all together our code will now look like this:
{{{
jQuery(document).ready(function () {
     juice.setDebug(true);
     juice.loadJs("http://www.example.com/juice/extensions/GoogleAnalytics.js");
     juice.loadJs("http://www.example.com/juice/extensions/JuiceSimpleInsert.js");
     juice.onJsLoaded(runExtensions);
});

function runExtensions(){

     new gasJuice(juice,"UA-123456-1");

     doCreatedBy();
}

function doCreatedBy(){

     var div = '<div id="extendedBy" style="display: block; width: 100%; text-align: center; clear: both;">' +
	'Extended by <a href="http://juice-project.googlecode.com">The Juice Project</a></div>';

     var insert = new JuiceInsert(div,"body","append");
     new simpleInsertJuice(juice,insert);
}	
}}}

*Note:* Google only update their statistics every 24 hours, so don't expect any statistics until the day after you add this extension.
